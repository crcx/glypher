Glypher
============================================================================
Glypher is a programming platform oriented towards visual programming and
game development. It runs on the Windows platform.

The language is a cross between RetroForth (7th Generation) and ColorForth.
As a colored Forth, it uses different colors (assigned to function keys)
to determine the action to take with code. It also has a tightly integrated
editor.

When Glypher starts, you get a random introduction screen. This is generated
by a small program on block 20. You can navigate through the blocks by using
ALT+the arrow keys.

Inside a block, use the arrow keys to move around. To delete a word, place
the cursor directly after the word and press delete.

To enter a word, type in the word and then press the function key that
corresponds to the color action you wish to take. Use the normal space bar
to simply execute the word.

Use 'save' to save your blocks and 'bye' to quit Glypher. Look around, tweak
things, and have fun! If you do anything interesting with it, please feel
free to share your results with us.



Color      Use
============================================================================
RED        Define a forth word
ORANGE     Define a macro word
GREY       Compile a Forth word, or execute a macro word, or
           compile a number as a literal. Searches the macro
           dictionary first.
BLUE       Compile a macro word, or have a macro compile a Forth
           when executed
CYAN       Execute forth words only; compile a literal if the next
           word is GREY. Macros will not work here.
MAGENTA    Create a variable inside the source
WHITE      Comments; do nothing
GREEN      Define a string. on GREEN to non-green, the string is
           compiled, EXCEPT when the next color is CYAN, then it
           is placed on the stack.
